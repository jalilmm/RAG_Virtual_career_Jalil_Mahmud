# Virtual_JalilMahmud_careerAI

A conversational AI chatbot app designed specifically to assist in presenting Jalil Mahmud's career qualifications and how he fits the team and job. The chatbot leverages a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach using open-source technologiesâ€”integrating HuggingFace models and FAISS for efficient document retrieval and memory search, hosted with a visually appealing and modern HTML/CSS frontend.

With AWS S3 integration, the application retrieves the necessary FAISS files and metadata directly from the cloud, ensuring seamless access across deployments.
